Version 0.11
============
- Added a new table "Tag" to track tags associated with downloads.
- Added a progress count to review_alerts.py.
- Added the ability to grab "tags" in review_alerts.py and then do a bulk action on anything matching the grabbed tags.
- Separated out a release branch on git.
- Consolidated versions to a single version for the entire project. I don't know why I broke it out in the first place.
